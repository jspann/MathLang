OakLang
=======

This is a basic language called Oak (not to be confused with James Gosling's language). It is inspired by Julia, Python and Octave. Its purpose is to simplify the evaluation of certain math functions. The syntax is described in syntax.txt (in the docs folder).

It is still a work in progress and isnt ready for primetime just yet!
